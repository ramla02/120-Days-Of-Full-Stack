# 📌 Day 6 — Image Manipulations with CSS

Today’s project focused on experimenting with CSS filters to manipulate images in different creative ways.
This helped me understand how filters work and how they can be used to achieve cool visual effects with very little code.

This project was fun and artistic.
Playing with filters helped me understand how designers control mood and color in UI design.
It’s a small project, but every little skill is building my confidence.
