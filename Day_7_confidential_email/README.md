# 📌Confidential Email Layout with CSS Transform & Positioning
This project recreates a stylized confidential email using HTML and CSS, focusing on layout skills, element positioning, and visual effects.
The goal is to understand how to use absolute positioning, CSS transforms, and blur effects to create realistic “CONFIDENTIAL” and “TOP SECRET” stamps on a document.
